# F-J_disperison_spectrograms_picking
Dispersion spectrograms were used to train and test the domain confusion, improving the training of neural network from multiple source domains
We give many dispersion spectrograms extracted by F-J transform or synthesized by us. The labelled dispersion curves we give are corresponding to synthetic data of small-scale.
As for data from China SW, China NE, and USArray TA, readers can easily use 'ginput' function in MATLAB or Python to label them.
